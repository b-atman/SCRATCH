I appreciate the mods for allowing us to host this AMA and hope to do another one soon.** 



Hi, I’m Alex Woodward, a senior U.S. reporter at the Independent. My work has covered everything from Trump’s immigration policies and legal battles to voting rights, anti-abortion laws, discrimination, and the rise of far-right movements and media. Recently, my reporting has highlighted Trump’s deportation agenda within his first 100 days in office: approximately 137 men have been transferred to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Meanwhile, at least 1,500 student visas have been revoked across more than 250 universities, targeting international students — many of them pro-Palestinian advocates critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. Trump’s crackdown isn’t limited to immigrants; he’s openly stated he would be “very happy” to send “homegrowns” to El Salvador’s prisons too. **Ask me anything. I will begin answering questions at 1:30 pm ET.**

Here are some links to stories that may be useful:
